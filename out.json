Got a few for decorations at son birthday party.. it was a huge hit.. we didn\u2019t open them till after the guests left but my son had a blast when we did.. loved all the surprises that came out!\n"},
{"grade": 5.0, "review title": "Maybe the funniest plush toy I've seen in my life :-D", "comment": "\n  What a cool plush toy !  It is so hilarious !  I'm in my 30's , placed it on a drawer chest next to my bed and it makes me laugh when I look at it .  It looks ridiculous and foolish and I say that as a compliment haha .  I think it is very creatively designed , it is indeed soft and silky to the touch .  It looks to me like a pretty complicated plush toy to stitch together and considering that the manufacturer did a pretty good job(I don't think it has to be 100% perfect in this case) .  I only paid 6$ or 7$ dollars for it and I think it is well worth the money .  It can be one of the most special plush toys you will give your child .  Much more interesting than a classic bear or barbie toy .  I just saw it by chance on amazon and added it to my basket cause it immediately caught my eye .  I don't like fortnite , nor do I know any characters from there and I never played it .  So I think it is irrelevant whether you like fortnite but if your kid does maybe that would be a bonus for him\\her .\n"},

{"grade": 5.0, "review title": "For your little Fornite fan!", "comment": "\n  If your kid is addicted to Fortnite, they will probably love this!  There is so much detailed in this little stuffy, and it is very soft.  My son loves it and has been sleeping with it since he got it as a \"good behavior reward\".  Just a reminder though, pay attention to the size chart, this is about the size of a soda can and I can hold it in the palm of my hand.  If you are looking for something big, this is not for you.  For the price we paid ($10), I think it's reasonable and a good value.\n"},

So for that 3. It\u2019s small read the description I think this plush should sell for less but I guess if you a fan it\u2019s worth it I never played this game fort nite I got it for a lil 10 year girl who loves it so much. Anyways the plush is nice but the wait wasn\u2019t I needed up giving it to my daughter since I had to buy a vbucks gift card at the store for the lil girl.\n"},

My 8 year old Fortnite-obsessed son took one look at it and said \"What a rip-off! That's not even what they look like.\" I agree. I was hoping he wouldn't mind but this thing is ugly and a terrible knock-off of the item from the game. 7\" mayyyybe if you measure diagonally - it's not much larger than a beanie baby.\n"},
